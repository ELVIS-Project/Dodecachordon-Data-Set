## Dodecachordon - Book I - Literature Examples
+ Full pieces
  - a mass movement is a full piece
  - m. 1 - final cadence
  - a larger part of a piece
    + for compositions in two or more parts

### Naming Conventions

File naming convention:
+ Include from which book it came
+ Include the name of the piece or example
+ If there are two examples of the same type on the same page append the file name with the next logical number.
+ Add the page number
  - If a piece or example is referenced in the text, and then shown in the appendix, look at the example below 

Thus a file name should look like:
- Book-1_Example-1_p-47.pdf
or
- Book-3_De-profundis_p-266_p-447.pdf (In the book, and the appendix)
or
- Book-1_Alma-redemptoris-mater-2_pp-57-58.pdf

## Monophonic Examples

### Time Signature and Bars
+ Make each line of the example one long bar
  - The location of line breaks may be important, so do not attempt to save space by grouping lines together.
+ Enter the time signature as [number of notes in the line]/4
+ Hide the time signature and bar lines
  - In MuseScore2, you can do this from the Inspector pane.
+ Enter each note as a stemless quarter note
  - In MuseScore2, you can select this option in the Inspector pane.

### Clefs
+ Employ the exact same clefs as the example, if possible
  - Since the staffs only have 4 lines, ignore the uppermost line of the modern 5-line staff
    - E.g., A baritone clef (a C clef on the uppermost line) in Glarean will become a tenor clef in your example

### Ligatures
+ Enter ligatures as slurs
+ These slurs should always be placed above the note
  - In MuseScore2, select the slur and then press “x” to flip its orientation
+ Rules of thumb about ligatures:
  - For ligatures with one note on top of the other, the bottom note comes first.
  - Group noteheads that are connected into one ligature 
  - A note with a tail followed by diamond notes is also one ligature
    - Exception: When there are repeated pitches

### Barlines
+ Enter barlines as breath marks
  - In MuseScore2, you must be on the Advanced Workspace to see the Breaths & Pauses palette
+ Enter double barlines as double breath marks
  - If there are double barlines at the end of each line, it is possible that the example should be broken up--Check with Julie to verify
+ Generally, barlines separate complete words, but only indicate a barline where one is indicated in the example

### Text
+ Include the text
+ Although the examples lack hyphens indicating melismas, transcribers should follow typical formatting conventions for lyrics: hyphens in between syllables of the same word
  - If MuseScore2 fails to show hyphens, select the note and press the left arrow key until a hyphen appears
+ Reproduce the spelling, punctuation, and capitalization of the example, even if there are errors or inconsistencies
+ Rules for text underlay:
  - Syllables do not change during neumes
